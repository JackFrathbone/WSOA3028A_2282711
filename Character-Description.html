        <h1>Character Description & Rationale</h1>
        <h2>Who is Simon Wessels?</h2>
        <p>The last lone remaining member of the Johannesburg Amateur Historical Society(JAHS), Simon is simply just a
            middle
            aged
            man whose entire life has been a disappointment. While he also always had some fun reading and learning
            about history, his boredom at his job as a dentist lead him to find some preoccupation. This is when he
            discovered JAHS, a small dying society, which becomes something for him to latch on to, to continue his
            dream
            of a life more fulfilling than dentistry and his quiet marriage.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the end he joins up with the society and quickly becomes its most active member, organizing many events
            and pushing for a more active society. But his energy and passion alongside is extreme weirdness starts to
            grow into an obsession, that alongside the already dying form that is small local societies, leads to JAHS
            losing all of its members. This doesn't deter Simon though, and he continue to run the society as if it were
            something real, hosting events for himself and using its platform to push his ideas and theories, which
            start to become more strange and conspiratorial. So in the end JAHS exists as a screen through which Simon
            can project his ideas and his image as a scholar, while hiding the fact he both isn't that knowledgeable and
            that his is basically going insane.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Does Simon?</h2>
        <p>
            Simon exists as an outpouring of frustration from his own mediocrity, with JAHS being the outlet that lets
            out the inner turmoil of someone who seems extremely ordinary and extremely boring in person. The site
            explores how a platform, any platform, can reveal things about someone like Simon when they get the power to
            speak with authority. Though Simon doesn't have any authority, being a leader of 0 members, but he believes
            he has power and that is enough.
            <br>
            <br>
            This sites reflects an alternate personality of Simon, opposed to his quiet dentist side. And through the
            events and snippets of things he seems to do in person for the society, it can be seen how he lets the work
            of the society take over his life and time.
        </p>
        <h2>The Future for JAHS and Simon</h2>
        <p>While currently the site is somewhat tame, and simply has some corrupted articles and strangely glitchy
            photos, the long term plan is to use the Article section of the site. This will be quite long, and as the
            user scrolls the content will get more glitched out and the 'history facts' being shared will be more wrong
            or twisted. This will makeup an entire self contained story, using many different elements and media.
            Similar things will be done, but less, in the events sections.</p>
