                Blog 13: <em>Reflection on The Radical AI Podcast</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                This time it was not a reading, but a listening to reflect on, with an episode of the Radical AI
                Podcast. The series in general focuses on the realms of computers, the internet and digital age, and
                where it connects to politics and ethics, with this specific episode being an interview with Ruha
                Benjamin on what she refers to as the ‘New Jim Code (Benjamin, 2020). Benjamin discusses the many ways
                that algorithms and various digital applications have racism, bias and other discriminatory features
                built in through the design.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main point raised throughout the episode is that these discriminatory designs are not just straight
                forward features made explicit by racists, but instead how biases and implicit racism sneaks into code
                and algorithms, creating barriers for people who are deemed ‘other’ by the code. This collection of
                discriminatory designs is described as the ‘New Jim Code’ in reference to the historical Jim Crow
                segregation laws in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main reason Ruha Benjamin gives for the existence of these design practices is the bleeding of real
                world racism, bias and discrimination into the essence of design, exemplified by the overall focus of
                design on the imagined typical user, usually a white north american man. This sort of implicit bias was
                shown with the example of smart soap dispensers that were designed around white hands, failing to detect
                darker skin colours. The designers might not be explicitly racist in their intent, but by failing to
                take into consideration all types of people who may use their design, they fail to be accessible and in
                turn discriminate.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is of course, just like the previously discussed digital divide and accessibility issues, just
                another factor that any conscious web designer or programmer must take into consideration. Design is not
                neutral but exists with a lot of assumptions, about the user, about how things should be done. Students
                are usually taught a correct way to do things without really interrogating why they do it like that, and
                through this all sorts of bad design and bias can enter design.
            </p>
            <p>
                My own website, which is designed to create a sense of nostalgia for the old web of the 90’s and early
                2000’s carries assumptions about what elements make a site like that feel old and ‘retro’ to users.
                There are possibly plenty of places in the world where sites may still look ‘old’ like that, and my own
                ideas of how it should feel come from my own experiences. I would probably be very wrong to assume that
                every single person would share my exact same sense of nostalgia and understanding of ‘retro’ websites.
                Benjamin's New Jim Code isn't just a call to fight racism in web design, but also in general to be more
                conscious and more critical as designers about every element we use, to really understand how we impart
                our own bias and understanding into our designs. A more universal and accessible web is only possible
                when designers actually create critically, and think fully about the implications of their code.
