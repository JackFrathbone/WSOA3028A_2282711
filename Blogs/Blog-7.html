                Blog 7: <em>Reflection on Interpreting the Layout of Web Pages</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                This essay by Luis Francisco-Revilla and Jeff Crow looks at the layout of web pages in terms of how they
                are read or interpreted, with the aim of understanding how the information on websites is understood.
                This is also done with accessibility in mind, trying to understand how assistive technologies find it
                difficult to distinguish various bits of information on a website compared to visual reading, and by
                understanding how websites are read by people it can help make these assistive technologies better at
                reading the important information and content (Francisco-Revilla & Crow, 2009).
            </p>
            <p>
                The main content of the essay is the research done by the authors where they recorded how various people
                read some webpages, tracking how long it took them to find key information and how exactly they
                navigated from element to element. While the essay deals with these results and it is a lot of
                information, it comes out with a result that shows the more complex a page in terms of information and
                layout, the longer it takes for it to be understood, and that with more elements users are more likely
                to read them in different ways. The authors themselves suggest this shows how important it is for
                assistive technologies like text readers to understand the framing of a page so only the most relevant
                and important information is read, and in the best order to be understood.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of this is very useful information and shows how important both the design of the layout is, but
                also how without some form of guidance text readers find it difficult to find the important content in a
                web page without getting bogged down. This relates directly to semantic markup, which while not
                mentioned at all, exists to help text readers and bots to easily understand web pages in order to get
                the key content. Using semantic markup the web designer of a site can help mark exactly what is the
                content that a reader needs to look at, and help order all the various elements on a page. And while
                this may not have much of an effect on the visual of the site it makes it more accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this essay, just like semantic markup itself, poses a question to all designers that when making
                their sites, they need to think not just about the visual side of design, but really understand and
                analyse how their information is read and understood by all users. By being critical in terms of
                semantics, the designer will hopefully think more about the way they present information to all users,
                and if their current layouts and formats help the user to find and understand the content properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                This article does a good job of showing a side of web design that may not be at first obvious, but in
                order to make better websites and a web that is more accessible to everyone, it is always important for
                designers and developers to be more critical in their approach to layout and semantic markup, which this
                essay highlights the difference that simple and clear layout can make.
