                Blog 4: <em>How does the ‘Medium is the Message’ Impact Our Understanding of the Web?</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                While it may be simple to just say that McLuhan predicted the internet of today, and the way that
                computers would transform many functions of everyday life, the fact is that Marshall McLuhan did not
                just simply predict the new digital frontier, but also warned about the dangers and changes that such
                technology brings with it. His most important idea, especially in relation to the internet, is that of
                the ‘medium is the message’ which can be boiled down into the idea that it is not just the content of
                any media that is important for understanding it, but the very medium it is transferred to holds its own
                conventions and messages that affect how the content is consumed. As someone who studied media and its
                social effects, McLuhan was already aware of how media could impact people's thoughts and shape their
                views very subtly, with most people not having the tools to understand and analyse the everyday media
                they were confronted with and thus not realise how it affects them.

                Despite now having been around for over thirty years, the web is still very much a new and changing
                thing, and as more traditional media migrates to websites and more stuff goes online, the importance of
                understanding the web and internet has become more important. McLuhan's ideas become very powerful here,
                because his concept of mediums themselves having meaning helps people analyse the difference between a
                piece of media in traditional print, and one online, that while they may have the same exact content(ie
                text), the way they are consumed and viewed by the public is very different. Obviously a film in a
                theatre and on a laptop can be the exact same frame by frame piece of work, but they are interpreted and
                viewed very differently because of the medium through which they are transmitted. The web contains many
                media in it, and these are all transmitted and accessed in so many ways, all very differently from any
                analogue medium.
            </p>
            <p>
                With these ideas in mind it now becomes possible to start truly analysing the internet, because so much
                of the content online is ‘traditional’ in that it copies paper pages, places images and film neatly, and
                tries in many ways to replicate an analogue experience. But it is not analogue, and though the margins
                and white background of a news article may look just like paper, they are transmitted from server to
                computer, and rendered to the viewers screen. And the viewer doesn’t buy a newspaper from the store, but
                searches for or is linked directly to the article, the access and context of the content is completely
                different. So the medium itself becomes the message, and if this is not understood then it becomes
                impossible to truly understand how much the internet differs from all other media that have come before.
