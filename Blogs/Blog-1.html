      </h1>
      <p>
        The ubiquity and global acceptance of the internet today has meant that for many people, its existence goes
        relatively unquestioned. But what today seems mundane and normal was once something dreamt and theorised by
        scientists and futurists who wondered how technology would change the future and how it would shape the people
        who
        used it everyday. The three readings to be discussed, two by the author Jorge Luis Borges and one by American
        engineer Vannevar Bush, both come from the early 20th century at a time when the pace of technology, and
        especially
        that of the new field of computing, was moving rapidly. With new technology came questions about how information
        may
        exist in different forms, with Borges exploring the realm of data and information and Bush looking at how
        technology
        would increase the accessibility of knowledge and how people processed information. While these ideas at the
        time
        were relevant and interesting, with the creation of the internet their ideas gained new meaning and seemed to
        relate
        directly to the current existence of both data and information online.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Library of Babel by Borges describes a theoretical space where infinite hexagons of books, containing
        randomised letters and punctuation, contain all possible writings of the past and future (Borges, 2018). While
        Borges obviously had no idea of how the internet would exist in the future, his core idea of infinite books has
        not only been simulated online, but holds relevance to the vast amounts of data held on the global web. And in
        many ways the problem presented by Borges infinite library, that despite holding all possible books, the amount
        of pure gibberish one would have to go through to even find a few legible words makes useful information
        inaccessible. The internet presents a similar problem, that despite holding so much information, one needs to
        know how and what to search for in order to access any knowledge, just the existence of useful knowledge online
        doesn't make it accessible or useful for the vast majority of people.
      </p>
      <p>
        While The Garden of Forking Paths, also by Borges, does touch on similar themes of infinite data, it takes on a
        different angle, but just as relevant to the modern web (Borges, 2000). In the story, a book is described as
        being an ‘infinite labyrinth’ by containing all possible choices and paths simultaneously. This can be directly
        related to how most information actually exists on websites, especially online games, where all choices and
        outcomes actually exist in code or somewhere on a server already, and while users might take choices linearly
        all outcomes are possible. A person can backtrack to a previous page and choose a different link, all possible
        outcomes can be investigated.
      </p>

        The last reading was the article by Bush, As We May Think, which is less ‘relatable’ to the internet now than
        simply a good guess about how computers would develop to store information, with Bush predicting how people
        would use computers to store personal files, books and other information for quick access and study (Bush,
        1945). But while Bush saw the positive side of this, personal knowledge being stored and accessed, he could not
        foresee the shared nature of the internet that holds knowledge, but is not personally curated by an individual
        with their own books and files but instead contains information for the entire public. This public sharing of
        knowledge does not however, as Bush thought, lead to a computerised extension of personal knowledge and memory.
        Just because a classic book is free online, doesn't seem to mean the majority of people will read and learn from
        it.
