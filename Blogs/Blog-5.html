            <h1>
                Blog 5: <em>The importance of Accessibility</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                The world wide web, as in the name, is an international network that connects servers all across the
                world. This means that by its very nature, the web has to serve all of humanity, across languages and
                various regional contexts. To serve all of humanity also requires the web to not just cater to languages
                but also people with disabilities or other issues that mean they access the web in a different way. So
                this is where accessibility and the issues around access become very important. The main issue that
                currently stands is simply that the web is not centrally controlled or coordinated in any meaningful
                way, so it is up to individual hosts to provide many of the current means of accessibility, and it is
                now mostly up to those who need to access these features to speak and raise awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessibility can range from a variety of things, and this is also why it can be hard to define a single
                path for web developers to take in making a website accessible. From simply organising text and content
                in a way that text readers can easily follow, to giving descriptions to images, people with visual
                impairments who use a text reader can be catered too. But this does require planning and thought on the
                developers' side, making sure they clearly think about how someone would go through the text on the site
                and removing any content that is not necessary or related that would interfere with the flow. At this
                point the effort needed to be put into a website to make it accessible begs the question of whether it
                is really necessary?
            </p>
            <p>
                While it could be simply put that of course all people have a right to access content no matter their
                impairments, accessibility isnâ€™t simply just about disabled people. But the very process of making a
                website more accessible also helps developers critically think about the content and flow of their site,
                and how it will be read and used by people with various needs. And thinking about this stuff, and being
                critical of design choices can only lead to a better overall design of the site. It is also important to
                note that many accessibility features also generally work with web bots to better break up and organise
                information when using search engines or RSS feeds, so overall it benefits the site to be accessible,
                once again not just for disabled people, but in overall making the website more universally accessible
                to all people.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion the benefits of adding accessibility outweigh any time or effort put into them, because if
                we want the web to be a truly universal and accessible space, that requires critical design and thinking
                by web developers and all those who use spaces on the web to share content. Without any central
                authority, it is up to the worldwide web of individual servers to create a more cohesive and better
                space for everyone, and accessibility is a core part of this.
