                Blog 3: <em>A reflection on McLuhan, M. ‘The Medium is the Message’</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                When Marshall McLuhan coined the phrase “the medium is the message” in 1964, he couldn’t have possibly
                known exactly how the modern internet would end up looking, but yet his ideas now seem to be more
                important than ever before. As the worldwide web, and the various applications and programs spread
                through it, have become mainstream, it is more important than ever to understand the social and cultural
                effects that access to these many new mediums has caused. As an important figure in media theory,
                McLuhan has a strong interest in how changing technology would give rise to new mediums, and how exactly
                people should define and understand how these mediums worked. His own definition of medium does differ
                from other definitions, with McLuhan stating that a medium was any extension of ‘ourselves’ i.e.
                humanity. In this way he gave a much broader view to technological changes, like his example of how a
                lightbulb is a medium in that it creates spaces with light that are much more accessible than a dark
                space, but at the same time the medium of a lightbulb is devoid of content.

                If a medium can have an effect, changing an environment or giving access to something, yet not have any
                content, then this shows his core idea that the medium itself is ‘the message’ and contains, aside from
                the content, its own characteristics and effects. This way of viewing communication mediums is very
                interesting especially in light of the internet and web now. An email is simply just text, and the
                content may be no different to a letter sent 500 years ago, but the medium of the email and how it is
                sent and near instantly received, the differing importance of getting emailed vs a letter arriving in a
                postbox, is essential to start analysing how fundamentally different an email is to a letter. Thus the
                analysis shifts from the content, to the medium, and it allows greater understanding of the fundamental
                changes in our world inflicted by the growth of new media.

            <p>
                Continuing with the email example, viewing the accessibility of the medium does show how much it affords
                over traditional forms of text communication. An email is fast, it acts as an extension of speech, it
                has its own rules with the convention of having a subject line. An email can also be simultaneously
                sent, where a letter would need to be printed or simply written again. But McLuhan's ideas are so
                important because, and something he stressed too in his critiques of modern media, was that the
                mundanity of things like email and websites obscures the function they play in society and their effects
                on all sorts of things. If people don’t see the messages inherent in the medium they won't be able to
                understand their own relations to it. If you don’t realise that email is vastly different to writing
                letters, you won’t ever unpack the ways you write and read the things you are emailed. For criticism and
                understanding to exist, people need to know how the everyday media they are exposed to leave impressions
                and them and affect their own actions.
