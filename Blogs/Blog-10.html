                Blog 10: <em>Reflection on User experience - a research agenda</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                This week's reading is looking at the term and concept of user experience(UX), focusing on creating a
                broad overview of what the term means and the different avenues of research and work related to it
                (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006). It also suggests pathways for further discussion and development of UX
                theory in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                UX as a field has really grown in recent years, and become very important for web and app developers
                making digital applications who want to create an overall better experience for users in terms of
                response and navigation. But the article points out that the term UX is not just new and increasingly
                popular, but has been vaguely defined by people across academic and professional fields. Hassenzahl and
                Tractinsky state that the lack of empirical research on UX “impedes theoretical advancement and
                restricts our understanding of UX as concept and its further development”, calling for greater study of
                the field to help unify understanding of what makes a ‘good’ user experience (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky,
                2006: 91).

                The essay talks about how UX developed as a response to the older form of user design which was
                human–computer interaction(HCI). HCI focused mostly on the tasks of the user, how well they executed
                them, and the idea of usability. UX broke away from this more utilitarian focus to look at other ways
                that users navigate and move through digital spaces, and how this can be engaging and users can be drawn
                to take certain actions which the designers want them to do. While both UX and HCI cover a large range
                of design needs, the article talks about how both fields need to take into account the variety of ways
                design can be improved to satisfy the technical needs of the designer, while also satisfying the
                aesthetic and functional needs of the user.
            </p>

                Later in the article the experiential nature of UX is discussed, and this part is particularly important
                for modern web design. The article says that “an experience is a unique combination of various elements,
                such as the product and internal states of the user” (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006: 94). This suggests
                that there is a behavioural element to design, requiring the designer to think about the emotional
                response they want to create in their user, and how this can contribute to the experience of the
                website. For my own website this idea is important and useful to think about.
            </p>

                While an old website may create a sense of nostalgia for the user simply by its outdated style and
                layout, this was never an active intention on the side of the creator. But for my site, I want to
                replicate that same feeling of nostalgia alongside the dread of an old abandoned website with personal
                information, but it's not possible to just create it as if I was back in the 90’s. So in the process of
                creating my site, I have had to think actively about its aesthetics and how to create the specific
                emotional response I want through the UX. This also raises a question about the necessity of certain
                ‘bad’ design elements that my site has to create my intended emotional response. While I have purposely
                designed some aspects to be an unpleasant experience on purpose, is it possible to follow what is
                considered good UX practice now, like smooth menus and various helpful popups, while not detracting from
                the emotional response I seek to evoke? For now, the concept of UX, and thinking about the various
                complex interactions between user and interface that occur, has really helped me design and style my
                website towards my desired aesthetic and overall ‘vibe’.
