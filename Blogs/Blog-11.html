            <h1>
                Blog 11: <em>Website Self-Critical Analysis: UX & UI</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                For this week, looking at the website itself will be the content of this blog. While I have previously
                discussed theories around UX and briefly mentioned how I have applied some of these concepts to the
                website, it would be good to have a critical look at what there is right now, what works, what doesn’t,
                and present some ideas for how the website could be improved overall in terms of UX in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, an important step when designing anything is to think about the goals of the design, what the
                desired outcome is. Since the start of the website, my main goals have always been to create a sense of
                nostalgia in the viewer, by making my website feel like something out of the early 2000’s, and recreate
                the sense of nostalgia that comes with finding an old website for a long gone restaurant or society. But
                the other feeling I wanted to foster was a sense of unease, with the website having a horror element to
                it that causes the viewer to feel mildly uncomfortable as the content they look at gets more disjointed
                and weird.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to meet those goals I looked at some old websites for reference like <a
                    href="http://www.theradium.co.za">theradium.co.za</a>
                which is an old pub in Joburg, alongside various sites hosted on <a
                    href="http://www.Neocities.org">Neocities.org</a>. But just adding some old
                school style CSS and weird posts would not be enough, so I had to really think about how I could use
                layout and UX to maximise my desired effects. My first attempt, as shown in image 1, was to simply use
                minimalism in order to make the site feel old, keeping use of colors and space as simple as possible to
                make it feel as if only barebones HTML was used to create the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                This plan was scrapped after having learned more about UX, as I realised that I could make the site's
                layout and design more complicated and better for the user, while still retaining the old site. If
                anything, many old websites have elements of over-design, with too much going on and ugly contrasting
                colors and tiling background images. So I arrived at my second design, image 2, by focusing on the UI
                elements that would have the most impact on the site's overall aesthetic, while allowing certain other
                elements to feel more modern and usable. The use of thick separating lines, and the three color text
                buttons for the menus helped a lot in pushing the retro aesthetic while the content box with the dashed
                line border was both much better to look at and also helped focus the user on specific content.
            </p>
            <p>
                My current layout still leaves a lot to be desired, especially with the navigation menu not having any
                response from clicking the buttons. Adding some sort of on click color change, or animation, could
                really help make it feel more tactile, while not taking away from the current look and feels of the
                buttons. I also feel that the ‘Out of Character’ section that hosts these blogs could do with some sort
                of overhaul. This part of the website which does not need to be as focused on the aesthetic, could do
                with overall better design aimed at usability and experience, and could serve as a showcase for the
                purposefully ‘bad’ elements present on other parts of the site.
