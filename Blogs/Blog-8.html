                Blog 8: <em>On the Digital Divide</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                The internet has become more and more accessible and widely available with each year, as globally prices
                drop and devices like smartphones become even more commonplace. But no matter how affordable and
                universal the internet becomes, it will always be a reflection of humanity across the world, including
                the inequality between people and places. The idea of the digital divide is that real world inequality
                is now reflected online, as with so many key services and important information being accessible on the
                internet, and new services like news and internet shopping, people who do not have access to the
                internet are becoming increasingly disadvantaged. Also part of this gap between those with access and
                those without, is that those without internet don’t have any say in the content online so historically
                privileged peoples take up a greater share of the internet and have a greater influence on its content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mark Graham in the essay Internet Geographies: Data Shadows and Digital Divisions of Labour examines how
                historical and real world inequalities are reflected in online spaces (Graham, 2014). One important
                aspect, that is very useful from an african perspective, is how those groups privileged with more and
                longer term internet access, take up a larger part of the internet, their stories and ideas feature much
                more and their influence is stronger. This means that overall african voices are much rarer online than
                those from the United States and Europe, who tend to culturally dominate big internet spaces like
                Youtube and Twitter, which means stories and ideas from many parts of the world are harder to find and
                share, and the overall ‘culture’ of the internet becomes more western centric.
            </p>
            <p>
                Graham shows how the historical inequalities between regions that affect other media, also affects the
                internet, and the importance of building a better internet that is more accessible and open to all
                peoples, an internet that actively combats digital divides that exist, because this allows more
                perspectives and voices to flourish online. Robinson et al also point out that “digital inequalities
                continue to combine with race, class, gender, and other offline axes of inequality” (Robinson et al,
                2015: 2) which shows how any fight against global inequality both affects the internet, but also is
                affected by the internet, which serves as a platform for all people who have access to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inequality has consequences both in reality and digitally, and if things are left as they are the
                internet will continue to be dominated by privileged voices that sideline and marginalise the majority
                of people in the world who come from countries with less access. As long as digital inequality exists
                then the internet will function as a segregated space that provides access for only a section of
                humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
                With all this in mind, it raises the importance of thinking about digital divides when designing online
                spaces, and how we can continue to build an internet that combats marginalisation and welcomes more
                people. While designers may not be able to put more people online, they can make sure those with less
                access get a bigger share in terms of space to tell stories and share information, creating a more
                diverse and representative internet for all of humanity, breaking the barriers that exist in the real
                world.
