                Blog 9: <em>A close reading of Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies”</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                This blog post takes a look at an interesting article that provokes some serious questions about data
                and information. <em>Toward a study of Information Geographies</em> is an essay that looks into the
                difference in
                information across the world, and how just like real world geographies, information also exists in an
                unequal state (Graham et al, 2015).
            </p>
            <p>
                The article starts off by stating an obvious if important fact, that all information has a physical
                source, it comes from somewhere and most likely someone too. Networks of all sorts transport and mediate
                the information to wherever it gets outputted. This framing is used throughout the rest of the article
                and is an important point to remember when evaluating any information, to think of the physical source
                and the process of transportation it took to get to the reader. So information has a geographical
                source, but as pointed out next, geography also plays a role in how it is received, and how it can be
                transformed into something new. Information can be adapted and edited by those who receive it from
                somewhere else, whether this is simply translation or a deeper process of making the information more
                useful in a local context.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the previous introduction in mind, the essay discusses how information can exist in ‘immutable
                mobiles’ which “crystallise informational layers of places in a moveable container” with an example of a
                map that has abstracted and bounded information in it (Graham et al, 2015: 89). This idea is then
                connected to the concept of ‘immutable augmentations’ which is instead about how layers of information
                exist over geographic spaces, such as physical buildings that have online guides, reviews and other data
                connected to the real world space. These layers of data on top of real geography exert a large amount of
                influence on the real world and shape people's perspectives, a well reviewed and recommended restaurant
                might find itself having many more customers, or a digital map might guide people down streets they
                might normally have missed. To study these layers of interaction between geography and layers of data is
                to look into the ‘geography of information’.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next sections of the essay look at pre-digital geographies of information, such as newspapers, and
                points out how these were unequally distributed globally. Information has always been connected to
                global and geographical inequality in terms of local production and distribution. With most information
                production being in the global north historically, this has meant it took up a greater percentage of
                information shared around the world, and thus the perspective of the global north became more dominant.
                This inequality is then viewed against the idea of the ‘information revolution’ brought about by the
                digital age where the possibility of more equal access and production of information seems possible. But
                while it may be more possible, the existing inequalities across the world, especially access in many
                poorer countries to computers and internet, mean that the digital age still sees global inequality
                reflected online.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point the work related very well to Mark Graham's other piece on the digital divide Internet
                Geographies: Data Shadows and Digital Divisions of Labour (Graham, 2014). That article discussed how
                historically privileged voices continue to dominate discourse on the internet as the physical inequality
                and lack of access across the world still favours wealthier and more powerful countries at the expense
                of others. This same issue is pointed out in this article, with it looking at things such as the
                affordability of broadband internet, and rates of internet usage, and how these differ with some
                countries having a majority of their population online, while others still only a minority have access.
                A graph in the article shows clearly how certain countries, mostly in the global north, have a much
                higher amount of registered internet domains, which serves as a useful indicator for how much content on
                the internet comes from certain places.
            </p>
            <p>The next sections all reinforce the central point, that it is certain places in the world that produce a
                larger share of content on the internet, and that this is related to geographical and political
                inequality and differences. This means that people from poor countries, or from unprivileged
                backgrounds,have less of a voice and less content overall on the internet. There is concentration of
                information in some geographical areas over others. In the end the essay finished by pushing the
                importance of studying this phenomenon, stating that knowing about inequality and the uneven existence
                of information online, helps to develop and study ways to address this issue and build a more accessible
                and representative internet. Overall study of digital inequality is an important endeavour, and Robinson
                et al states “an integrative and forward-looking approach which retains the lessons of the past will
                serve us well”, with many more paths of study opening up to understand both the path and potential
                futures of the internet and the digital divide (Robinson et al, 2015: 579).</p>
