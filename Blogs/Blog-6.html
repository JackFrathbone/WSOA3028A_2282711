                Blog 6: <em>Reflection on Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology</em>
            </h1>
            <p>
                This article written by Steve Gibson back in 2004 is a particularly interesting highlight of how little
                computer interfaces have really changed in over 17 years, and how the new suggestion of ways we can
                radically change our interfaces are similar to the ideas from back in the 90’s (Gibson, 2004). In the
                article Gibson talks firstly about the main limitations present in modern computer interfaces, mainly
                the mouse and keyboard, which he says are developed along the lines of practicality and ergonomics. But
                these interfaces don’t break radically in any way from analogue interfaces of the past such as
                typewriters which keyboards evolved from, and they don't take advantage of the wide array of new
                technologies that show different and new ways people can interact with computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main content of the articles looks at these new computer interfaces, from hands free tracking and
                MIDI based controls, to the more strange electrode based controls of the artist Stelarc's cybernetics.
                Gibson shows these different forms of interface not as an alternative to the keyboard and mouse as a new
                standard, but instead raises the idea of more specialised and alternative computer interfaces that come
                with completely different design and artistic philosophies to the standardised and practical keyboard.
                This is the most interesting and important aspect of the article, because it raises many more questions
                about how the standardisation of computer interfaces may itself be a limit on digital interaction and
                creativity, and how the way we interact with a computer or device can completely change the way we use
                and think about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of my own general work, this article makes me think about how common interfaces like keyboards
                and phone touch screens completely guide but also limit the ways we develop programs and websites, and
                this both makes it easy to design for an average computer user it also puts strict limitations on how
                most people interact with computers. By starting to think about alternate interfaces, designers can both
                realise the limitations of our current interfaces and how in the future we can push design towards new
                and exciting forms of computer interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now Gibson also raises the point about how changing the way we interact with something can really
                change how we relate and understand it. While designing a website usually it is designed to be as easily
                understandable and navigable with the normal interfaces like mouse, touch screen etc, but by changing
                the interface or using it differently it can completely change the feel of the website and create
                certain emotions. For example if a user was forced to navigate a page solely with their keyboard where a
                mouse would be normal, this may make the user frustrated, but could also be done in such a way to feel
                unique or new, and force the user to experiment with these alternate controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the alternative interfaces mentioned by Gibson never became widely used or known, the idea of
                rethinking the general approach to computer interfaces, and the result of using more specialised
                interfaces, does raise many interesting questions about how the technologies of the future might finally
                break the standard forms we have been using with computers for the last 30+ years, and the new
                possibilities this offers for designers.
