        Blog 2: <em>The promise and peril of User Generated Content</em>
      </h1>
      <p>
        Before even the internet let alone modern computers ever existed, there were ideas that technology would change
        the accessibility of art and information, and this would change how content and all sorts of media would be
        developed. As the handheld camera let someone shoot a film at home without the need for a Hollywood set and
        crew,
        computers and the internet opened up many roads for the people to learn and create content easier than ever
        before. But what the internet and web specifically allowed, that had not existed previously, was the ease that
        people could now publish their own content. No longer did someone necessarily need a publisher for their book
        for
        it to exist and be consumed by others, a website could be hosted at home and with some self advertisement people
        across the world could see a self-published text hosted online.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this era of self-publishing came websites that hosted user generated content, working in both worlds of
        self-publishing and more traditional media publishing. These sites, like the still monolithic Youtube for video
        content, could hold some say and control over material hosted on them, and get profit, but still allow creators
        to
        put their own content to be accessed by the websites audience. So these sites don’t need to produce their own
        content, letting their users upload media that brings in other users. Now user generated content exists in many
        forms, including even modifications to games and even programming projects where members of a community
        contribute
        to development.
      </p>
      <p>
        User generated content opens up new routes for collaboration and sharing of information, it is usually much
        easier
        than individuals hosting their own content and bringing people to their website. But it also raises many
        different
        and new issues, shared across most user content based websites. The first is the hosts of said content, who by
        owning the site and giving ‘consent’ for the users to post their content, have a responsibility for the
        management
        of the content and even in some cases are legally responsible for crimes and violations arising from the hosting
        of illegal content. This means few websites host content now without systems for checking what is being posted,
        and alongside this requirement of content monitoring arises issues of censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
        For users, a host website seems to offer opportunities for them to create work and easily share it, but in
        reality
        they actually lose a lot of control over their own creations when they are hosted. YouTube videos can be taken
        down because of alleged copyright infringement, and Facebook regularly takes down political content based on its
        own opaque community guidelines. The overall feelings of the majority of users won’t necessarily reflect in how
        these sites are managed because they are not democratic, but usually owned by corporate entities who use them to
        profit. And these platforms can hold control over the speech of their users and what content can appear, making
        them much more curated then they may appear. For both the host and user, the promise of free publishing of
        content
        and sites grown by the input and content of their users, is not quite the straightforward path it seems, and
        brings up questions of how free the internet really is and who should have a say in what appears on it.
