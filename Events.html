                Starting off the new season of walking tours of east Joburg, we will be meeting this Sunday just
                outside
                the bowls club at Rhodes Park. We will be looking at some old houses of historical value in the
                area,
                passing by our office in Bez Valley for short discussion. Hosted by our resident expert on
                historical
                archeitecture and board member <del>Mila Botha</del> Simon Wessels.
                <br>
                <br>
                We will then end up back at the bowls club for drinks. Walk should last about three hours with
                plenty of
                breaks. Free to members and R100 for non-members.

                Hi everyone, after the recent successes of our last meetup where we got more than 3̵̡͖͔̦͋̂͋̔̓͑
                new
                non-members to show up, it was decided that we are going to move our yearly conference to this
                months
                end. We missed out on our membership conference and meetup last year due to covid, so it'll be
                good to
                make up for our lost momentum, otherwise we have to wait for October.
                <br>
                <br>
                This years conference will graciously be held at the Woodpecker Bowls Club in historic Bez
                Valley and
                not far from <del>my house</del> our office. This also means we will have to a chance to give a
                short
                little tour of the ground and discuss the history of the local area.
                <br>
                <br>
                Non members are 100% welcome and can come sign up at our office before we start, so they can
                come and
                join in straight in the conference. Please feel free to come and join if you want to be involved
                in
                local history and learning more about this city and its history.
                <br>
                <br>
                As usual, entry for members is R25 and signup for non members is R100 for the year.
