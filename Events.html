                Starting off the new season of walking tours of east Joburg, we will be meeting this Sunday just outside
                the bowls club at Rhodes Park. We will be looking at some old houses of historical value in the area,
                passing by our office in Bez Valley for short discussion. Hosted by our resident expert on historical
                archeitecture and board member <del>Mila Botha</del> Simon Wessels.
                <br>
                <br>
                We will then end up back at the bowls club for drinks. Walk should last about three hours with plenty of
                breaks. Free to members and R100 for non-members.
